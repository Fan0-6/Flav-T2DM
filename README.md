# T2DMFlavonoidClinicalInsight: Efficacy of Dietary Flavonoids in T2DM Biomarker Management

Welcome to the T2DMFlavonoidClinicalInsight GitHub repository, where we delve into the impact of dietary flavonoids on managing key biomarkers for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This project compiles and analyzes data from 28 randomized controlled trials to evaluate how flavonoid consumption affects fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism in T2DM patients.

Utilizing a random-effects model, our findings highlight significant improvements in fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR (insulin resistance), triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-C levels in those consuming flavonoids compared to placebo. These results indicate a modest yet statistically significant benefit of flavonoids on glucose and lipid metabolism, crucial for T2DM management.

T2DMFlavonoidClinicalInsight provides an extensive analysis, including mean difference calculations, heterogeneity assessment with Cochran’s Q-statistic and Higgins I² test, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses. This meticulous approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the flavonoids' effects, with a keen eye on methodological robustness and statistical significance.

This repository is a goldmine for researchers, healthcare practitioners, and anyone interested in the nutritional management of T2DM. It includes datasets, R code for statistical analysis, and a detailed exploration of the effects of dietary flavonoids on T2DM biomarkers. Our goal is to offer a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in dietary interventions for diabetes care.
