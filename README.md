# T2DM_Flavonoid_Clinical_Insight: Efficacy of Dietary Flavonoids in T2DM Biomarker Management

Welcome to the T2DMFlavonoidClinicalInsight GitHub repository! Our mission is to explore the impact of dietary flavonoids on managing key biomarkers for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This project is the culmination of extensive research compiling and analyzing data from 28 randomized controlled trials. Our focus lies on evaluating how flavonoid consumption affects fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism in T2DM patients.

## Project Overview

This repository provides a deep dive into the potential benefits of flavonoids for T2DM management. By meticulously analyzing randomized controlled trial data, we offer insights into how these compounds influence crucial diabetes biomarkers like fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin resistance.

## Code and Methodology

### Literature Searching Strategy

Our literature search adhered to the PRISMA statement guidelines, focusing on English publications from 2001 to 2021. We sourced our data from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, utilizing a comprehensive set of search terms related to flavonoids and T2DM. The R package revtools was employed to preprocess the dataset, eliminating duplications, followed by a screening process using the ASReview tool, which employs active learning to identify relevant studies.

### Data Extraction

We meticulously extracted and summarized information regarding study authors, participant characteristics, interventions, study design, and outcomes. This process included gathering mean values, standard deviations, and sample sizes for a detailed meta-analysis.

### Quality Assessment

Using the Cochrane collaboration tool, we assessed the risk of bias across seven domains for each study, ensuring the integrity and reliability of our findings.

### Data Synthesis and Analysis

Our analysis employed a random-effects model to calculate mean differences and assess study heterogeneity. We conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses to refine our understanding of flavonoid impacts, addressing potential sources of heterogeneity and assessing the effects of various study factors.

## Findings

Our findings indicate statistically significant improvements in key T2DM biomarkers for individuals consuming flavonoids compared to placebo groups. These results underscore the potential of flavonoids to benefit glucose and lipid metabolism, crucial aspects of T2DM management.

## Repository Contents

- Datasets from the analyzed trials
- R code for conducting statistical analysis

## Goal

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, healthcare practitioners, and anyone interested in the nutritional management of T2DM. We believe this repository will serve as a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in dietary interventions for diabetes care.
